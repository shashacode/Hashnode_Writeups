## My Journey Into Tech

### Figuring myself out
As a kid, while growing up I always aspired to do things that involved building, thinking, solving problems and generating results. I could pick up a toy plane and start thinking of how to dismantle it then remodel it into something else but for the fear of being disciplined for destroying the toy (as they would think; since they can‚Äôt see the final picture in my head), I wouldn‚Äôt try it. Also when I watch animations my favourite then was Superman I start picturing myself with a cape and saving the world so I always saw myself as an action superheroine. 

So when asked the question what do you want to become in life I ponder on it because I knew what I wanted but didn‚Äôt just know the right occupation that fits inüòï.

Suggestions started streaming in like you know you could be a ‚Äúdoctor, or a pharmacist or a nurse‚Äù but I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be all of those. Then it seem like what I wanted was just a fantasy and imagination that spurred from my childhood interest. Eventually, I settled for being a doctor since it was similar to my dream of being a superheroine which involves saving people.

### Indecisive
When I eventually grew to the age where I get to pick a course of study for my career I wasn‚Äôt sure anymore if I wanted to be a doctor so I just decided to go for something else. Going to pick up my JAMB form (the exam done to get into school) my family thought I was going to fill in Medicine as my choice of study but I told them I changed my mind on the spot and chose something else. 

Fast-forward to me currently, in school studying Biotechnology which was not totally satisfactory until I finally found a niche that bare much similarity to my childhood dream of building, thinking, solving problems and generating results. I finally saw that I wasn‚Äôt all in my head and just being imaginative as I thought but what I wanted truly exists and there‚Äôs a word for it which wasn‚Äôt a word I was new to but just one I never thought of exploring because I thought it wasn‚Äôt meant for me. 

Simply I found tech was the word I searched for all my life üòÖ which had been staring at me in the face but was oblivious to. 

### Realization
My perception of tech over the years growing up seem like a field where only genius thrives and especially since society found a way to gate-keep it from the female gender while steering them to career paths that seem feminine and befitting for a woman. 

Finding out the tech field is open to all especially since I enjoy solving problems and see myself save the world through solutions proffered I have then come to embrace the field more. #WomenWhoTech
